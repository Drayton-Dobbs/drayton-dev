        Growing up in poverty, I was determined to break the cycle and strive
        for more. When I was younger (15-17), I used to help my dad with his
        cleaning business. One day, while cleaning a financial office, I saw
        these cool monitors with graphs and heat maps all over the wallâ€”numbers,
        data, and bright colors everywhere. That moment sparked my interest in
        coding and app design.

        . In the beginning, I thought this industry would definitely be more
        lucrative than being a server. So financial gain was my main reason for
        exploring this industry until I eventually (as soon as I learned CSS
        haha) found a love for designing well-made responsive apps.

        Over the past five years, I&apos;ve honed my skills and expertise in key
        areas of web development. I specialize in JavaScript (JS), TypeScript
        (TS), Node.js, and React/Next.js, leveraging these technologies to build
        dynamic and responsive web applications. My experience includes a
        four-month intensive learning through the IAmBham web development
        course, followed by a year of hands-on experience applying for jobs and
        refining my skills.
