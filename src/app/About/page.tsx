      <p className="pb-2">
        Hey there, I&apos;m Drayton! Thanks for visiting my corner of the
        internet. Let me share a bit about my journey into the world of web
        development.{" "}
      </p>{" "}
      <p className="pb-2">
        Growing up in poverty, I was determined to break the cycle and strive
        for more. When I was younger (15-17), I used to help my dad with his
        cleaning business. One day, while cleaning a financial office, I saw
        these cool monitors with graphs and heat maps all over the wallâ€”numbers,
        data, and bright colors everywhere. That moment sparked my interest in
        coding and app design.
      </p>{" "}
      <p className="pb-2">
        Back then, I had no real way to dive into coding until, a few years
        later, I stumbled upon a free web development bootcamp called IAmBham.
        In the beginning, I thought this industry would definitely be more
        lucrative than being a server. So financial gain was my main reason for
        exploring this industry until I eventually (as soon as I learned CSS
        haha) found a love for designing well-made responsive apps.
      </p>{" "}
      <p className="pb-2">
        Over the past seven years, I&apos;ve honed my skills and expertise in
        key areas of web development. I specialize in JavaScript (JS),
        TypeScript (TS), Node.js, and React/Next.js, leveraging these
        technologies to build dynamic and responsive web applications. My
        experience includes a four-month intensive learning through the IAmBham
        web development course, followed by a year of hands-on experience
        applying for jobs and refining my skills.
      </p>{" "}
      <p className="pb-2">
        {" "}
        In late 2019, I found my first job in the field at Moss Rock Solutions,
        formerly known as Scott Howard Consulting, where I&apos;ve had the
        privilege of contributing to impactful projects and expanding my
        knowledge in the tech industry. This journey has not only shaped me as a
        developer and human but also instilled in me a passion for creating
        innovative solutions and pushing the boundaries of what&apos;s possible
        in web development.{" "}
      </p>{" "}
      <p className="pb-2">
        {" "}
        I&apos;m excited to share my experiences and insights with you, and I
        invite you to explore more about my work and connect with me to discuss
        all things tech and beyond.
